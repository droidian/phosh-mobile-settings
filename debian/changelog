  * panel-switcher: Allow going back to same page in folded mode.
    Rename on_visible_child_changed() in MobileSettingsWindow to
    show_content_cb(), since that's what it is doing.
    Connect this signal handler also to the 'row-activated' signal of
    MsPanelSwitcher so that the content page is shown in folded mode also
    when the visible child of the stack does not change.

    now `meson setup` aborted when phoc isn't found.
    This unbreaks the nightly builds:

  * packaging: Add breaks against old phosh-osk-stub.
    We want at least 0.37.0 to have the ignore-hw-keyboards key

    This allows to always show the OSK, even when a hardware keyboard is
    present.
  * ci: Update common function and use template job.
    Use meta-phosh as of f3c92e90dcc0d65322888217429b75dd101bd0d3

    common style check.
  * packaging: Bump phosh dependency.
    We need 0.37.0 for the Quick Setting gsettings schema
  * plugin-list-box: Add widget that manages phosh plugins.
    This is based on the implementation in the lock screen panel.

    Phosh 0.38.0 is now in testing.

  [ Rudra Pratap Singh ]
  * application: Add local option to output version
  * applications-panel: Reword Favorites row title
  * applications-panel: Make favorites flowbox homogeneous.
    This will ensure each added favorite within the
    flowbox occupies same size, irrespective of
    the number of favorites.
  * applications-panel: Allow to append a favorite via flowbox.
    With this, a favorite can be dropped on the
    flowbox which will be appended at the end.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * lockscreen-panel: Only show lockscreen plugins.
    With more plugin types coming to phosh via
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phosh/-/merge_requests/1359
    we want to make sure we only list the plugins with a "lockscreen"
    type here.
    For a transition phase we assume that no type means "lockscreen".  This
    can be dropped in the future.
  * application-panel: String consistency.
    Use imperative form, unify spelling.
  * ci: Switch ci back to Debian Trixie.
    We have libadwaita 1.4 and Debian sid is going through a larger
    library transition atm.
  * packaging: Allow to fetch subprojects.
    This unbreaks the package build
  * gmobile: Update to 0.0.6. Go with the flow.
  * packaging: Depend on libjson-glib-dev.

  * application: Override handle_local_options vfunc.
    This will allow for handling some options locally
    (e.g., --version) efficiently by registering
    array of accepted options.
  * settings-window: Extend API to access stack pages.
    Adds a getter method to access the pages of
    GtkStack object
  * application: Add local option to list panels.
    Adds the `--list` local option to list the

    We don't use it and it just causes failures when the remote is
    unavailable.
  * window: Set log domain
  * applications-panel: Remove trailing whitespace
  * packaging: Require recent phoc.
    This is needed to make touch DnD work
  * applications: Disable favorite arrangement with too old GTK.
    The code to organize favorites needs DnD on touch. This was only fixed
    recently in phoc 0.34.0~beta1:
      384d755f ("cursor: Don't forget to update the drag icons position")
    and GTK 4.13.2:
      d78475372f ("gtk: Obey GTK grabs on DnD events")
    So disable that part of the panel when GTK is too old.
  * debug-info: Use a single line for the OS.
    This will make it simpler to use the pretty name.
  * debug-info: Move os info gathering to separate function.
    This will allow us to make it more complex.
  * debug-info: Try harder to get usable OS information.
    On Debian the testing/sid the OS version is NULL. Try pretty name too to
    make that useful.
  * packaging: Require newer phosh
  * osk: Allow to set the unfold delay
  * l5-panel: Init temperatures.
    This ensures they don't contain garbage in case sensors_get_value()
    doen't set them.
  * application: Don't use self for GApplication
    self refers to an object of type PhoshMobileSettingsApplication not
    GApplication. Adjust the variable names in functions that did this
    differently. This makes it obvious where casts are needed.
    While at that fix an overly long line by introducing a variable.

    Fixes c31f81f3476ac9903916c105ac01aa1594067bc5
  * build: Bump meson dependency to 0.58.0
    str.replace() (used for glib_ver_str) is only available since 0.58.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * window: Use a larger default size.
    This makes things less fiddly on larger screens
  * gitignore: Ignore generated pot file
  * build: Fix gettext name.
    This allows translations to be found
  * feedback-panel: Separate feedback settings from setting their labels.
    We want the labels to be translatable while the stings uses for
    settings should be untranslated.
  * po: Translate some DE strings.
    This allows to test i18n.
  * Add osk panel.
    This allows to toggle OSK usage on and off and (if phosh-osk-stub is
    used) to configure the word completion mode.

phosh-mobile-settings (0.24.1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * plugins-row: Use full path to open prefs plugin
  * lockscreen-panel: Mention in error message that it's a prefs plugin.

    plugin info load failures

  * lockscreen-panel: Make panel scrollable.
    It's necessary epsecially in landscape orientation

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * lockscreen-panels: Drop plugins that start with '/'
    This clears out plugins that were accidentally added with the full path.
    Fixes: 26b2f1c88f3dc9078d24df43167761dc1e01c632

phosh-mobile-settings (0.23.1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * metainfo: Add releases
  * metainfo: Drop Purism::form_factor.
    The duplicate key (rightfully) tips up metainfo validation
    and we also have `display_length` set as well.
  * Revert "build: Make phosh-dev dependency optional for the moment"
    There's now a release shipping the pkg-config files so let's drop this
    to avoid inconistencies between builds that use pkg-config and those
    that use hardcoded paths.
  * ms-plugin-row: Don't overwrite plugin name with file name.
    (Fixes: #22)

  * main: Use SPDX-License-Identifier
  * application: Fix parent class
  * build: Avoid deprecated get_pkgconfig_variable
  * build: Bump glib dependency to 2.66
  * README: Use meson consistently
  * build: Use meson's version_compare.
    This avoids a warning as meson now knows we're excluding
    code base on it's version
  * build: Depend on phosh-plugins
  * plugin-panel: Fix typo
  * lockscreen-panel: Fix typo
  * lockscreen-panel: Allow plugins to have preferences
  * build: Make phosh-dev dependency optional for the moment.
    This allows us to build until phosh-dev ends up in distros.

phosh-mobile-settings (0.22.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * l5-panel: Don't forget to bind the suspend button.
    Otherwise we can't make it (un)sensitive
  * window: Don't forward to welcome page.
    This createes unneeded flicker and adds one additional tap
    every use to go back to the panel.
  * window: Move device panel addition to constructed.
    As pointed out by exalm doing this in realize is a bad idea.
    We had it there as we wanted to access GApplication but that wasn't set
    as prop yet but we can simply use g_application_get_default()
  * main: Use G_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_FLAGS to avoid depreation warning.
    Provide a fallback for older glib until we can enforce 2.74.
  * build: Add and use app id
  * app: Use AdwAboutDialog.
    In contrast to GtkAboutDialog it's adaptive and fits phone screens.
    For that we need to bump the adwaita dependency to 1.2.
  * l5-panel: Don't forget to bind the suspend button.
    Otherwise we can't make it (un)sensitive
  * window: Don't forward to welcome page.

  * ms-convergence-panel: Explain how to fetch the values for adding new docks
  * Revert "lockscreen-panel: Mark additional widgets as experimental"
    This currently makes the window overflow (although it should be word
    wrapped)

  [ Kyle Rankin ]
  * Add support for UPERFECT X Mini lapdock.
    This adds convergence panel support for the UPERFECT X Mini lapdock:

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * ci: Use newer Debian Bookworm image.
    This lets the builds pass again.
  * build: Plugin uses gio bits.
    Add a proper dependency
  * data: Update the appstream release information
  * Move plugins to phosh-mobile-settings/ folder
  * Allow to enable and disable lockscreen plugins (Closes: #12)
  * lockscreen-panel: Use plugin info.
    Don't just rely on the plugin path but rather parse the available
    information so we can have translated descriptions, etc.
  * lockscreen-panel: Don't try to read from inexistent dir
  * lockscreen-panel: Mark additional widgets as experimental

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * librem5-plugin: Adjust sensor mappings for temperatures.
    On the Librem 5, bq25890_charger driver reports the temperature
    as monitored by the thermisor inside the battery, while the
    max170xx_battery driver reports the internal temperature of
    the fuel gauge chip. Adjust sensor descriptions to match that.
